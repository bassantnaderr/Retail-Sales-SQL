# Project Overview

This project focuses on analyzing a **retail dataset** to gain insights into various aspects of customer demographics, sales trends, product categories, spending patterns, and price distributions. The data analysis was performed using **MySQL**, and below are the key questions and insights generated from the analysis.
## Data Structure

The dataset consists of the following columns:

- **Transaction ID**
- **Date**
- **Customer ID**
- **Gender**
- **Age**
- **Product Category**
- **Quantity**
- **Price per Unit**
- **Total Amount**


## Tools Used

- **MySQL**

## Key Questions
1. **How does the age and gender of customers influence the total amount spent per transaction?**
2. **What age group tends to purchase from each product category the most?**
3. **What are the monthly and daily sales trends, and are there particular days of the week that generate higher sales?**
4. **Are there seasonal trends evident in sales volumes across different product categories?**
5. **Which product categories generate the highest total revenue?**
6. **How does the average price per unit vary across different product categories?**
7. **What is the average transaction value for different age groups and genders?**
8. **How does the quantity of items purchased relate to the total amount spent?**
9. **What is the distribution of product prices within each category, and are there any outliers?**
10. **How does the price per unit correlate with the quantity sold for each product category?**
11. **How many unique customers are there, and what percentage of total sales do they represent?**

## Insights

- **Age and Gender Impact**: Certain age groups (especially **25-34** and **35-44**) spend more on specific product categories, with **females** in the **Beauty** category generating the highest sales.
- **Sales Trends**: Sales spike during **summer months** and **weekends**, with higher sales on **Fridays** and **Saturdays**.
- **Top Product Categories**: **Beauty**, **Fashion**, and **Electronics** drive the highest revenue.
- **Price Distribution**: Most products are priced within the **medium price range**, with high-priced items showing lower sales volume.

## Limitations:
- **Seasonal Trends**: The dataset covers only a limited time frame, and therefore, insights into seasonal sales trends could be less reliable for long-term projections.
- **Limited Demographics Data**: The lack of detailed customer demographic information (e.g., income, occupation) makes it difficult to provide in-depth insights into customer preferences and behaviors.
